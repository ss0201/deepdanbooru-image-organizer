    Parameters
    ----------
    X : {array-like, sparse matrix} of shape (n_samples, n_features)
        The observations to cluster. It must be noted that the data
        will be converted to C ordering, which will cause a memory copy
        if the given data is not C-contiguous.

    n_clusters : int
        The number of clusters to form as well as the number of
        centroids to generate.

    sample_weight : array-like of shape (n_samples,), default=None
        The weights for each observation in `X`. If `None`, all observations
        are assigned equal weight.

    init : {'k-means++', 'random'}, callable or array-like of shape \
            (n_clusters, n_features), default='k-means++'
        Method for initialization:

        - `'k-means++'` : selects initial cluster centers for k-mean
          clustering in a smart way to speed up convergence. See section
          Notes in k_init for more details.
        - `'random'`: choose `n_clusters` observations (rows) at random from data
          for the initial centroids.
        - If an array is passed, it should be of shape `(n_clusters, n_features)`
          and gives the initial centers.
        - If a callable is passed, it should take arguments `X`, `n_clusters` and a
          random state and return an initialization.

    n_init : int, default=10
        Number of time the k-means algorithm will be run with different
        centroid seeds. The final results will be the best output of
        `n_init` consecutive runs in terms of inertia.

    max_iter : int, default=300
        Maximum number of iterations of the k-means algorithm to run.

    verbose : bool, default=False
        Verbosity mode.

    tol : float, default=1e-4
        Relative tolerance with regards to Frobenius norm of the difference
        in the cluster centers of two consecutive iterations to declare
        convergence.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
        Determines random number generation for centroid initialization. Use
        an int to make the randomness deterministic.
        See :term:`Glossary <random_state>`.

    copy_x : bool, default=True
        When pre-computing distances it is more numerically accurate to center
        the data first. If `copy_x` is True (default), then the original data is
        not modified. If False, the original data is modified, and put back
        before the function returns, but small numerical differences may be
        introduced by subtracting and then adding the data mean. Note that if
        the original data is not C-contiguous, a copy will be made even if
        `copy_x` is False. If the original data is sparse, but not in CSR format,
        a copy will be made even if `copy_x` is False.

    algorithm : {"lloyd", "elkan", "auto", "full"}, default="lloyd"
        K-means algorithm to use. The classical EM-style algorithm is `"lloyd"`.
        The `"elkan"` variation can be more efficient on some datasets with
        well-defined clusters, by using the triangle inequality. However it's
        more memory intensive due to the allocation of an extra array of shape
        `(n_samples, n_clusters)`.

        `"auto"` and `"full"` are deprecated and they will be removed in
        Scikit-Learn 1.3. They are both aliases for `"lloyd"`.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.18
            Added Elkan algorithm

        .. versionchanged:: 1.1
            Renamed "full" to "lloyd", and deprecated "auto" and "full".
            Changed "auto" to use "lloyd" instead of "elkan".

    return_n_iter : bool, default=False
        Whether or not to return the number of iterations.

    Returns
    -------
    centroid : ndarray of shape (n_clusters, n_features)
        Centroids found at the last iteration of k-means.

    label : ndarray of shape (n_samples,)
        The `label[i]` is the code or index of the centroid the
        i'th observation is closest to.

    inertia : float
        The final value of the inertia criterion (sum of squared distances to
        the closest centroid for all observations in the training set).

    best_n_iter : int
        Number of iterations corresponding to the best results.
        Returned only if `return_n_iter` is set to True.

    copy_x : bool, default=True
        When pre-computing distances it is more numerically accurate to center

            Changed "auto" to use "lloyd" instead of "elkan".

    Attributes
    ----------
    cluster_centers_ : ndarray of shape (n_clusters, n_features)
        Coordinates of cluster centers. If the algorithm stops before fully
        converging (see ``tol`` and ``max_iter``), these will not be
        consistent with ``labels_``.

    labels_ : ndarray of shape (n_samples,)
        Labels of each point

    inertia_ : float
        Sum of squared distances of samples to their closest cluster center,
        weighted by the sample weights if provided.

    n_iter_ : int
        Number of iterations run.

    n_features_in_ : int
        Number of features seen during :term:`fit`.

        .. versionadded:: 0.24

    feature_names_in_ : ndarray of shape (`n_features_in_`,)
        Names of features seen during :term:`fit`. Defined only when `X`
        has feature names that are all strings.

        .. versionadded:: 1.0

    See Also
    --------
    MiniBatchKMeans : Alternative online implementation that does incremental
        updates of the centers positions using mini-batches.
        For large scale learning (say n_samples > 10k) MiniBatchKMeans is
        probably much faster than the default batch implementation.

    Notes
    -----
    The k-means problem is solved using either Lloyd's or Elkan's algorithm.

    The average complexity is given by O(k n T), where n is the number of
    samples and T is the number of iteration.

    The worst case complexity is given by O(n^(k+2/p)) with
    n = n_samples, p = n_features. (D. Arthur and S. Vassilvitskii,
    'How slow is the k-means method?' SoCG2006)

    In practice, the k-means algorithm is very fast (one of the fastest
    clustering algorithms available), but it falls in local minima. That's why
    it can be useful to restart it several times.

    If the algorithm stops before fully converging (because of ``tol`` or
    ``max_iter``), ``labels_`` and ``cluster_centers_`` will not be consistent,
    i.e. the ``cluster_centers_`` will not be the means of the points in each
    cluster. Also, the estimator will reassign ``labels_`` after the last
    iteration to make ``labels_`` consistent with ``predict`` on the training
    set.

    max_iter : int, default=100

    batch_size : int, default=1024
        Size of the mini batches.

    compute_labels : bool, default=True
        Compute label assignment and inertia for the complete dataset

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
        Determines random number generation for centroid initialization and
        random reassignment. Use an int to make the randomness deterministic.
        See :term:`Glossary <random_state>`.

    tol : float, default=0.0
        Control early stopping based on the relative center changes as
        measured by a smoothed, variance-normalized of the mean center
        squared position changes. This early stopping heuristics is
        closer to the one used for the batch variant of the algorithms

    max_no_improvement : int, default=10

    init_size : int, default=None
        Number of samples to randomly sample for speeding up the
        initialization (sometimes at the expense of accuracy): the
        only algorithm is initialized by running a batch KMeans on a
        random subset of the data. This needs to be larger than n_clusters.

        If `None`, the heuristic is `init_size = 3 * batch_size` if

    n_init : int, default=3
        Number of random initializations that are tried.
        In contrast to KMeans, the algorithm is only run once, using the best of
        the `n_init` initializations as measured by inertia. Several runs are
        recommended for sparse high-dimensional problems (see
        :ref:`kmeans_sparse_high_dim`).

    reassignment_ratio : float, default=0.01
        Control the fraction of the maximum number of counts for a center to
        be reassigned. A higher value means that low count centers are more
        easily reassigned, which means that the model will take longer to
        converge, but should converge in a better clustering. However, too high
        a value may cause convergence issues, especially with a small batch
        size.

    Attributes
    ----------

    cluster_centers_ : ndarray of shape (n_clusters, n_features)
        Coordinates of cluster centers.

    labels_ : ndarray of shape (n_samples,)
        Labels of each point (if compute_labels is set to True).

    inertia_ : float
        The value of the inertia criterion associated with the chosen
        partition if compute_labels is set to True. If compute_labels is set to
        False, it's an approximation of the inertia based on an exponentially
        weighted average of the batch inertiae.
        The inertia is defined as the sum of square distances of samples to
        their cluster center, weighted by the sample weights if provided.

    n_iter_ : int
        Number of iterations over the full dataset.

    n_steps_ : int
        Number of minibatches processed.

        .. versionadded:: 1.0

    n_features_in_ : int
        Number of features seen during :term:`fit`.

        .. versionadded:: 0.24

    feature_names_in_ : ndarray of shape (`n_features_in_`,)
        Names of features seen during :term:`fit`. Defined only when `X`
        has feature names that are all strings.

    --------
    KMeans : The classic implementation of the clustering method based on the
        Lloyd's algorithm. It consumes the whole set of input data at each
        iteration.

    Notes
    -----
    See https://www.eecs.tufts.edu/~dsculley/papers/fastkmeans.pdf

    When there are too few points in the dataset, some centers may be
    duplicated, which means that a proper clustering in terms of the number
    of requesting clusters and the number of returned clusters will not
    always match. One solution is to set `reassignment_ratio=0`, which
    prevents reassignments of clusters that are too small.
