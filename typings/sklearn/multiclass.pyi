Multiclass classification strategies
====================================

This module implements multiclass learning algorithms:
    - one-vs-the-rest / one-vs-all
    - one-vs-one
    - error correcting output codes

The estimators provided in this module are meta-estimators: they require a base
estimator to be provided in their constructor. For example, it is possible to
use these estimators to turn a binary classifier or a regressor into a
multiclass classifier. It is also possible to use these estimators with
multiclass estimators in the hope that their accuracy or runtime performance
improves.

All classifiers in scikit-learn implement multiclass classification; you
only need to use this module if you want to experiment with custom multiclass
strategies.

The one-vs-the-rest meta-classifier also implements a `predict_proba` method,
so long as such a method is implemented by the base classifier. This method
returns probabilities of class membership in both the single label and
multilabel case.  Note that in the multilabel case, probabilities are the
marginal probability that a given sample falls in the given class. As such, in
the multilabel case the sum of these probabilities over all possible labels
for a given sample *will not* sum to unity, as they do in the single label
case.

class OneVsRestClassifier(MultiOutputMixin, ClassifierMixin, MetaEstimatorMixin, BaseEstimator):
    """One-vs-the-rest (OvR) multiclass strategy.

    Also known as one-vs-all, this strategy consists in fitting one classifier
    per class. For each classifier, the class is fitted against all the other
    classes. In addition to its computational efficiency (only `n_classes`
    classifiers are needed), one advantage of this approach is its
    interpretability. Since each class is represented by one and one classifier
    only, it is possible to gain knowledge about the class by inspecting its
    corresponding classifier. This is the most commonly used strategy for
    multiclass classification and is a fair default choice.

    OneVsRestClassifier can also be used for multilabel classification. To use
    this feature, provide an indicator matrix for the target `y` when calling
    `.fit`. In other words, the target labels should be formatted as a 2D
    binary (0/1) matrix, where [i, j] == 1 indicates the presence of label j
    in sample i. This estimator uses the binary relevance method to perform
    multilabel classification, which involves training one binary classifier
    independently for each label.

    Parameters
    ----------
    estimator : estimator object
        An estimator object implementing :term:`fit` and one of
        :term:`decision_function` or :term:`predict_proba`.

    n_jobs : int, default=None
        The number of jobs to use for the computation: the `n_classes`
        one-vs-rest problems are computed in parallel.

        ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context.
        ``-1`` means using all processors. See :term:`Glossary <n_jobs>`

    verbose : int, default=0
        The verbosity level, if non zero, progress messages are printed.
        Below 50, the output is sent to stderr. Otherwise, the output is sent
        to stdout. The frequency of the messages increases with the verbosity
        level, reporting all iterations at 10. See :class:`joblib.Parallel` for
        more details.
