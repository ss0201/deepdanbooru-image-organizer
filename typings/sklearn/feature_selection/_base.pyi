        Get a mask, or integer index, of the features selected.

        Parameters
        ----------
        indices : bool, default=False
            If True, the return value will be an array of integers, rather
            than a boolean mask.

        Returns
        -------
        support : array
            An index that selects the retained features from a feature vector.
            If `indices` is False, this is a boolean array of shape
            [# input features], in which an element is True iff its
            corresponding feature is selected for retention. If `indices` is
            True, this is an integer array of shape [# output features] whose
