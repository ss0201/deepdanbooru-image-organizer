    """Partial dependence of ``features``.

    Partial dependence of a feature (or a set of features) corresponds to
    the average response of an estimator for each possible value of the
    feature.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <partial_dependence>`.

    .. warning::

        For :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier` and
        :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor`, the
        `'recursion'` method (used by default) will not account for the `init`
        predictor of the boosting process. In practice, this will produce
        the same values as `'brute'` up to a constant offset in the target
        response, provided that `init` is a constant estimator (which is the
        default). However, if `init` is not a constant estimator, the
        partial dependence values are incorrect for `'recursion'` because the
        offset will be sample-dependent. It is preferable to use the `'brute'`
        method. Note that this only applies to
        :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier` and
        :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor`, not to
        :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.HistGradientBoostingClassifier` and
        :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.HistGradientBoostingRegressor`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    estimator : BaseEstimator
        A fitted estimator object implementing :term:`predict`,
        :term:`predict_proba`, or :term:`decision_function`.
        Multioutput-multiclass classifiers are not supported.

    X : {array-like or dataframe} of shape (n_samples, n_features)
        ``X`` is used to generate a grid of values for the target
        ``features`` (where the partial dependence will be evaluated), and
        also to generate values for the complement features when the
        `method` is 'brute'.

    features : array-like of {int, str}
        The feature (e.g. `[0]`) or pair of interacting features
        (e.g. `[(0, 1)]`) for which the partial dependency should be computed.

    response_method : {'auto', 'predict_proba', 'decision_function'}, \
            default='auto'
        Specifies whether to use :term:`predict_proba` or
        :term:`decision_function` as the target response. For regressors
        this parameter is ignored and the response is always the output of
        :term:`predict`. By default, :term:`predict_proba` is tried first
        and we revert to :term:`decision_function` if it doesn't exist. If
        ``method`` is 'recursion', the response is always the output of
        :term:`decision_function`.

    percentiles : tuple of float, default=(0.05, 0.95)
        The lower and upper percentile used to create the extreme values
        for the grid. Must be in [0, 1].

    grid_resolution : int, default=100
        The number of equally spaced points on the grid, for each target
        feature.

    method : {'auto', 'recursion', 'brute'}, default='auto'
        The method used to calculate the averaged predictions:

        - `'recursion'` is only supported for some tree-based estimators
          (namely
          :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier`,
          :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor`,
          :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.HistGradientBoostingClassifier`,
          :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.HistGradientBoostingRegressor`,
          :class:`~sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeRegressor`,
          :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor`,
          ) when `kind='average'`.
          This is more efficient in terms of speed.
          With this method, the target response of a
          classifier is always the decision function, not the predicted
          probabilities. Since the `'recursion'` method implicitly computes
          the average of the Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) by
          design, it is not compatible with ICE and thus `kind` must be
          `'average'`.

        - `'brute'` is supported for any estimator, but is more
          computationally intensive.

        - `'auto'`: the `'recursion'` is used for estimators that support it,
          and `'brute'` is used otherwise.

        Please see :ref:`this note <pdp_method_differences>` for
        differences between the `'brute'` and `'recursion'` method.

    kind : {'average', 'individual', 'both'}, default='average'
        Whether to return the partial dependence averaged across all the
        samples in the dataset or one line per sample or both.
        See Returns below.

        Note that the fast `method='recursion'` option is only available for
        `kind='average'`. Plotting individual dependencies requires using the
        slower `method='brute'` option.

    Returns
    -------
    predictions : :class:`~sklearn.utils.Bunch`
        Dictionary-like object, with the following attributes.

        individual : ndarray of shape (n_outputs, n_instances, \
                len(values[0]), len(values[1]), ...)
            The predictions for all the points in the grid for all
            samples in X. This is also known as Individual
            Conditional Expectation (ICE)

        average : ndarray of shape (n_outputs, len(values[0]), \
                len(values[1]), ...)
            The predictions for all the points in the grid, averaged
            over all samples in X (or over the training data if
            ``method`` is 'recursion').
            Only available when ``kind='both'``.

        values : seq of 1d ndarrays
            The values with which the grid has been created. The generated
            grid is a cartesian product of the arrays in ``values``.
            ``len(values) == len(features)``. The size of each array
            ``values[j]`` is either ``grid_resolution``, or the number of
            unique values in ``X[:, j]``, whichever is smaller.

        ``n_outputs`` corresponds to the number of classes in a multi-class
        setting, or to the number of tasks for multi-output regression.
        For classical regression and binary classification ``n_outputs==1``.
        ``n_values_feature_j`` corresponds to the size ``values[j]``.
