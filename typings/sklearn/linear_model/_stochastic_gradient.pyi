class SGDClassifier(BaseSGDClassifier):
    """Linear classifiers (SVM, logistic regression, etc.) with SGD training.

    This estimator implements regularized linear models with stochastic
    gradient descent (SGD) learning: the gradient of the loss is estimated
    each sample at a time and the model is updated along the way with a
    decreasing strength schedule (aka learning rate). SGD allows minibatch
    (online/out-of-core) learning via the `partial_fit` method.
    For best results using the default learning rate schedule, the data should
    have zero mean and unit variance.

    This implementation works with data represented as dense or sparse arrays
    of floating point values for the features. The model it fits can be
    controlled with the loss parameter; by default, it fits a linear support
    vector machine (SVM).

    The regularizer is a penalty added to the loss function that shrinks model
    parameters towards the zero vector using either the squared euclidean norm
    L2 or the absolute norm L1 or a combination of both (Elastic Net). If the
    parameter update crosses the 0.0 value because of the regularizer, the
    update is truncated to 0.0 to allow for learning sparse models and achieve
    online feature selection.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <sgd>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    loss : {'hinge', 'log_loss', 'log', 'modified_huber', 'squared_hinge',\
        'perceptron', 'squared_error', 'huber', 'epsilon_insensitive',\
        'squared_epsilon_insensitive'}, default='hinge'
        The loss function to be used.

        - 'hinge' gives a linear SVM.
        - 'log_loss' gives logistic regression, a probabilistic classifier.
        - 'modified_huber' is another smooth loss that brings tolerance to
           outliers as well as probability estimates.
        - 'squared_hinge' is like hinge but is quadratically penalized.
        - 'perceptron' is the linear loss used by the perceptron algorithm.
        - The other losses, 'squared_error', 'huber', 'epsilon_insensitive' and
          'squared_epsilon_insensitive' are designed for regression but can be useful
          in classification as well; see
          :class:`~sklearn.linear_model.SGDRegressor` for a description.

        More details about the losses formulas can be found in the
        :ref:`User Guide <sgd_mathematical_formulation>`.

        .. deprecated:: 1.0
            The loss 'squared_loss' was deprecated in v1.0 and will be removed
            in version 1.2. Use `loss='squared_error'` which is equivalent.

        .. deprecated:: 1.1
            The loss 'log' was deprecated in v1.1 and will be removed
            in version 1.3. Use `loss='log_loss'` which is equivalent.

    penalty : {'l2', 'l1', 'elasticnet'}, default='l2'
        The penalty (aka regularization term) to be used. Defaults to 'l2'
        which is the standard regularizer for linear SVM models. 'l1' and
        'elasticnet' might bring sparsity to the model (feature selection)
        not achievable with 'l2'.

    alpha : float, default=0.0001
        Constant that multiplies the regularization term. The higher the
        value, the stronger the regularization.
        Also used to compute the learning rate when set to `learning_rate` is
        set to 'optimal'.
        Values must be in the range `[0.0, inf)`.

    l1_ratio : float, default=0.15
        The Elastic Net mixing parameter, with 0 <= l1_ratio <= 1.
        l1_ratio=0 corresponds to L2 penalty, l1_ratio=1 to L1.
        Only used if `penalty` is 'elasticnet'.
        Values must be in the range `[0.0, 1.0]`.

    fit_intercept : bool, default=True
        Whether the intercept should be estimated or not. If False, the
        data is assumed to be already centered.

    max_iter : int, default=1000
        The maximum number of passes over the training data (aka epochs).
        It only impacts the behavior in the ``fit`` method, and not the
        :meth:`partial_fit` method.
        Values must be in the range `[1, inf)`.

        .. versionadded:: 0.19

    tol : float, default=1e-3
        The stopping criterion. If it is not None, training will stop
        when (loss > best_loss - tol) for ``n_iter_no_change`` consecutive
        epochs.
        Convergence is checked against the training loss or the
        validation loss depending on the `early_stopping` parameter.
        Values must be in the range `[0.0, inf)`.

        .. versionadded:: 0.19

    shuffle : bool, default=True
        Whether or not the training data should be shuffled after each epoch.

    verbose : int, default=0
        The verbosity level.
        Values must be in the range `[0, inf)`.

    epsilon : float, default=0.1
        Epsilon in the epsilon-insensitive loss functions; only if `loss` is
        'huber', 'epsilon_insensitive', or 'squared_epsilon_insensitive'.
        For 'huber', determines the threshold at which it becomes less
        important to get the prediction exactly right.
        For epsilon-insensitive, any differences between the current prediction
        and the correct label are ignored if they are less than this threshold.
        Values must be in the range `[0.0, inf)`.

    n_jobs : int, default=None
        The number of CPUs to use to do the OVA (One Versus All, for
        multi-class problems) computation.
        ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context.
        ``-1`` means using all processors. See :term:`Glossary <n_jobs>`
        for more details.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance, default=None
        Used for shuffling the data, when ``shuffle`` is set to ``True``.
        Pass an int for reproducible output across multiple function calls.
        See :term:`Glossary <random_state>`.
        Integer values must be in the range `[0, 2**32 - 1]`.

    learning_rate : str, default='optimal'
        The learning rate schedule:

        - 'constant': `eta = eta0`
        - 'optimal': `eta = 1.0 / (alpha * (t + t0))`
          where `t0` is chosen by a heuristic proposed by Leon Bottou.
        - 'invscaling': `eta = eta0 / pow(t, power_t)`
        - 'adaptive': `eta = eta0`, as long as the training keeps decreasing.
          Each time n_iter_no_change consecutive epochs fail to decrease the
          training loss by tol or fail to increase validation score by tol if
          `early_stopping` is `True`, the current learning rate is divided by 5.

            .. versionadded:: 0.20
                Added 'adaptive' option

    eta0 : float, default=0.0
        The initial learning rate for the 'constant', 'invscaling' or
        'adaptive' schedules. The default value is 0.0 as eta0 is not used by
        the default schedule 'optimal'.
        Values must be in the range `(0.0, inf)`.

    power_t : float, default=0.5
        The exponent for inverse scaling learning rate [default 0.5].
        Values must be in the range `(-inf, inf)`.

    early_stopping : bool, default=False
        Whether to use early stopping to terminate training when validation
        score is not improving. If set to `True`, it will automatically set aside
        a stratified fraction of training data as validation and terminate
        training when validation score returned by the `score` method is not
        improving by at least tol for n_iter_no_change consecutive epochs.

        .. versionadded:: 0.20
            Added 'early_stopping' option

    validation_fraction : float, default=0.1
        The proportion of training data to set aside as validation set for
        early stopping. Must be between 0 and 1.
        Only used if `early_stopping` is True.
        Values must be in the range `(0.0, 1.0)`.

        .. versionadded:: 0.20
            Added 'validation_fraction' option

    n_iter_no_change : int, default=5
        Number of iterations with no improvement to wait before stopping
        fitting.
        Convergence is checked against the training loss or the
        validation loss depending on the `early_stopping` parameter.
        Integer values must be in the range `[1, max_iter)`.

        .. versionadded:: 0.20
            Added 'n_iter_no_change' option

    class_weight : dict, {class_label: weight} or "balanced", default=None
        Preset for the class_weight fit parameter.

        Weights associated with classes. If not given, all classes
        are supposed to have weight one.

        The "balanced" mode uses the values of y to automatically adjust
        weights inversely proportional to class frequencies in the input data
        as ``n_samples / (n_classes * np.bincount(y))``.

    warm_start : bool, default=False
        When set to True, reuse the solution of the previous call to fit as
        initialization, otherwise, just erase the previous solution.
        See :term:`the Glossary <warm_start>`.

        Repeatedly calling fit or partial_fit when warm_start is True can
        result in a different solution than when calling fit a single time
        because of the way the data is shuffled.
        If a dynamic learning rate is used, the learning rate is adapted
        depending on the number of samples already seen. Calling ``fit`` resets
        this counter, while ``partial_fit`` will result in increasing the
        existing counter.

    average : bool or int, default=False
        When set to `True`, computes the averaged SGD weights across all
        updates and stores the result in the ``coef_`` attribute. If set to
        an int greater than 1, averaging will begin once the total number of
        samples seen reaches `average`. So ``average=10`` will begin
        averaging after seeing 10 samples.
        Integer values must be in the range `[1, n_samples]`.

    Attributes
    ----------
    coef_ : ndarray of shape (1, n_features) if n_classes == 2 else \
            (n_classes, n_features)
        Weights assigned to the features.

    intercept_ : ndarray of shape (1,) if n_classes == 2 else (n_classes,)
        Constants in decision function.

    n_iter_ : int
        The actual number of iterations before reaching the stopping criterion.
        For multiclass fits, it is the maximum over every binary fit.

    loss_function_ : concrete ``LossFunction``

    classes_ : array of shape (n_classes,)

    t_ : int
        Number of weight updates performed during training.
        Same as ``(n_iter_ * n_samples)``.

    n_features_in_ : int
        Number of features seen during :term:`fit`.

        .. versionadded:: 0.24

    feature_names_in_ : ndarray of shape (`n_features_in_`,)
        Names of features seen during :term:`fit`. Defined only when `X`
        has feature names that are all strings.

class SGDRegressor(BaseSGDRegressor):
    """Linear model fitted by minimizing a regularized empirical loss with SGD.

    SGD stands for Stochastic Gradient Descent: the gradient of the loss is
    estimated each sample at a time and the model is updated along the way with
    a decreasing strength schedule (aka learning rate).

    The regularizer is a penalty added to the loss function that shrinks model
    parameters towards the zero vector using either the squared euclidean norm
    L2 or the absolute norm L1 or a combination of both (Elastic Net). If the
    parameter update crosses the 0.0 value because of the regularizer, the
    update is truncated to 0.0 to allow for learning sparse models and achieve
    online feature selection.

    This implementation works with data represented as dense numpy arrays of
    floating point values for the features.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <sgd>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    loss : str, default='squared_error'
        The loss function to be used. The possible values are 'squared_error',
        'huber', 'epsilon_insensitive', or 'squared_epsilon_insensitive'

        The 'squared_error' refers to the ordinary least squares fit.
        'huber' modifies 'squared_error' to focus less on getting outliers
        correct by switching from squared to linear loss past a distance of
        epsilon. 'epsilon_insensitive' ignores errors less than epsilon and is
        linear past that; this is the loss function used in SVR.
        'squared_epsilon_insensitive' is the same but becomes squared loss past
        a tolerance of epsilon.

        More details about the losses formulas can be found in the
        :ref:`User Guide <sgd_mathematical_formulation>`.

        .. deprecated:: 1.0
            The loss 'squared_loss' was deprecated in v1.0 and will be removed
            in version 1.2. Use `loss='squared_error'` which is equivalent.

    penalty : {'l2', 'l1', 'elasticnet'}, default='l2'
        The penalty (aka regularization term) to be used. Defaults to 'l2'
        which is the standard regularizer for linear SVM models. 'l1' and
        'elasticnet' might bring sparsity to the model (feature selection)
        not achievable with 'l2'.

    alpha : float, default=0.0001
        Constant that multiplies the regularization term. The higher the
        value, the stronger the regularization.
        Also used to compute the learning rate when set to `learning_rate` is
        set to 'optimal'.

    l1_ratio : float, default=0.15
        The Elastic Net mixing parameter, with 0 <= l1_ratio <= 1.
        l1_ratio=0 corresponds to L2 penalty, l1_ratio=1 to L1.
        Only used if `penalty` is 'elasticnet'.

    fit_intercept : bool, default=True
        Whether the intercept should be estimated or not. If False, the
        data is assumed to be already centered.

    max_iter : int, default=1000
        The maximum number of passes over the training data (aka epochs).
        It only impacts the behavior in the ``fit`` method, and not the
        :meth:`partial_fit` method.

        .. versionadded:: 0.19

    tol : float, default=1e-3
        The stopping criterion. If it is not None, training will stop
        when (loss > best_loss - tol) for ``n_iter_no_change`` consecutive
        epochs.
        Convergence is checked against the training loss or the
        validation loss depending on the `early_stopping` parameter.

        .. versionadded:: 0.19

    shuffle : bool, default=True
        Whether or not the training data should be shuffled after each epoch.

    verbose : int, default=0
        The verbosity level.

    epsilon : float, default=0.1
        Epsilon in the epsilon-insensitive loss functions; only if `loss` is
        'huber', 'epsilon_insensitive', or 'squared_epsilon_insensitive'.
        For 'huber', determines the threshold at which it becomes less
        important to get the prediction exactly right.
        For epsilon-insensitive, any differences between the current prediction
        and the correct label are ignored if they are less than this threshold.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance, default=None
        Used for shuffling the data, when ``shuffle`` is set to ``True``.
        Pass an int for reproducible output across multiple function calls.
        See :term:`Glossary <random_state>`.

    learning_rate : str, default='invscaling'
        The learning rate schedule:

        - 'constant': `eta = eta0`
        - 'optimal': `eta = 1.0 / (alpha * (t + t0))`
          where t0 is chosen by a heuristic proposed by Leon Bottou.
        - 'invscaling': `eta = eta0 / pow(t, power_t)`
        - 'adaptive': eta = eta0, as long as the training keeps decreasing.
          Each time n_iter_no_change consecutive epochs fail to decrease the
          training loss by tol or fail to increase validation score by tol if
          early_stopping is True, the current learning rate is divided by 5.

            .. versionadded:: 0.20
                Added 'adaptive' option

    eta0 : float, default=0.01
        The initial learning rate for the 'constant', 'invscaling' or
        'adaptive' schedules. The default value is 0.01.

    power_t : float, default=0.25
        The exponent for inverse scaling learning rate.

    early_stopping : bool, default=False
        Whether to use early stopping to terminate training when validation
        score is not improving. If set to True, it will automatically set aside
        a fraction of training data as validation and terminate
        training when validation score returned by the `score` method is not
        improving by at least `tol` for `n_iter_no_change` consecutive
        epochs.

        .. versionadded:: 0.20
            Added 'early_stopping' option

    validation_fraction : float, default=0.1
        The proportion of training data to set aside as validation set for
        early stopping. Must be between 0 and 1.
        Only used if `early_stopping` is True.

        .. versionadded:: 0.20
            Added 'validation_fraction' option

    n_iter_no_change : int, default=5
        Number of iterations with no improvement to wait before stopping
        fitting.
        Convergence is checked against the training loss or the
        validation loss depending on the `early_stopping` parameter.

        .. versionadded:: 0.20
            Added 'n_iter_no_change' option

    warm_start : bool, default=False
        When set to True, reuse the solution of the previous call to fit as
        initialization, otherwise, just erase the previous solution.
        See :term:`the Glossary <warm_start>`.

        Repeatedly calling fit or partial_fit when warm_start is True can
        result in a different solution than when calling fit a single time
        because of the way the data is shuffled.
        If a dynamic learning rate is used, the learning rate is adapted
        depending on the number of samples already seen. Calling ``fit`` resets
        this counter, while ``partial_fit``  will result in increasing the
        existing counter.

    average : bool or int, default=False
        When set to True, computes the averaged SGD weights across all
        updates and stores the result in the ``coef_`` attribute. If set to
        an int greater than 1, averaging will begin once the total number of
        samples seen reaches `average`. So ``average=10`` will begin
        averaging after seeing 10 samples.

    Attributes
    ----------
    coef_ : ndarray of shape (n_features,)
        Weights assigned to the features.

    intercept_ : ndarray of shape (1,)
        The intercept term.

    n_iter_ : int
        The actual number of iterations before reaching the stopping criterion.

    t_ : int
        Number of weight updates performed during training.
        Same as ``(n_iter_ * n_samples)``.

    n_features_in_ : int
        Number of features seen during :term:`fit`.

        .. versionadded:: 0.24

    feature_names_in_ : ndarray of shape (`n_features_in_`,)
        Names of features seen during :term:`fit`. Defined only when `X`
        has feature names that are all strings.
