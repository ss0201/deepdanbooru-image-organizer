    r"""Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP).

    Solves n_targets Orthogonal Matching Pursuit problems.
    An instance of the problem has the form:

    When parametrized by the number of non-zero coefficients using
    `n_nonzero_coefs`:
    argmin ||y - X\gamma||^2 subject to ||\gamma||_0 <= n_{nonzero coefs}

    When parametrized by error using the parameter `tol`:
    argmin ||\gamma||_0 subject to ||y - X\gamma||^2 <= tol

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <omp>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : ndarray of shape (n_samples, n_features)
        Input data. Columns are assumed to have unit norm.

    y : ndarray of shape (n_samples,) or (n_samples, n_targets)
        Input targets.

    n_nonzero_coefs : int, default=None
        Desired number of non-zero entries in the solution. If None (by
        default) this value is set to 10% of n_features.

    tol : float, default=None
        Maximum norm of the residual. If not None, overrides n_nonzero_coefs.

    precompute : 'auto' or bool, default=False
        Whether to perform precomputations. Improves performance when n_targets
        or n_samples is very large.

    copy_X : bool, default=True
        Whether the design matrix X must be copied by the algorithm. A false
        value is only helpful if X is already Fortran-ordered, otherwise a
        copy is made anyway.

    return_path : bool, default=False
        Whether to return every value of the nonzero coefficients along the
        forward path. Useful for cross-validation.

    return_n_iter : bool, default=False
        Whether or not to return the number of iterations.

    Returns
    -------
    coef : ndarray of shape (n_features,) or (n_features, n_targets)
        Coefficients of the OMP solution. If `return_path=True`, this contains
        the whole coefficient path. In this case its shape is
        (n_features, n_features) or (n_features, n_targets, n_features) and
        iterating over the last axis generates coefficients in increasing order
        of active features.

    n_iters : array-like or int
        Number of active features across every target. Returned only if
        `return_n_iter` is set to True.

        If True, the regressors X will be normalized before regression by
