    Parameters
    ----------
    X : array-like of shape (n_samples, n_features) or BallTree
        Sample data, in the form of a numpy array or a precomputed
        :class:`BallTree`.

    n_neighbors : int
        Number of neighbors for each sample.

    mode : {'connectivity', 'distance'}, default='connectivity'
        Type of returned matrix: 'connectivity' will return the connectivity
        matrix with ones and zeros, and 'distance' will return the distances
        between neighbors according to the given metric.

    metric : str, default='minkowski'
        Metric to use for distance computation. Default is "minkowski", which
        results in the standard Euclidean distance when p = 2. See the
        documentation of `scipy.spatial.distance
        <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/spatial.distance.html>`_ and
        the metrics listed in
        :class:`~sklearn.metrics.pairwise.distance_metrics` for valid metric
        values.

    p : int, default=2
        Power parameter for the Minkowski metric. When p = 1, this is
        equivalent to using manhattan_distance (l1), and euclidean_distance
        (l2) for p = 2. For arbitrary p, minkowski_distance (l_p) is used.

    metric_params : dict, default=None
        Additional keyword arguments for the metric function.

    include_self : bool or 'auto', default=False
        Whether or not to mark each sample as the first nearest neighbor to
        itself. If 'auto', then True is used for mode='connectivity' and False
        for mode='distance'.

    n_jobs : int, default=None
        The number of parallel jobs to run for neighbors search.
        ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context.
        ``-1`` means using all processors. See :term:`Glossary <n_jobs>`
        for more details.

    Returns
    -------
    A : sparse matrix of shape (n_samples, n_samples)
        Graph where A[i, j] is assigned the weight of edge that
        connects i to j. The matrix is of CSR format.

    .. versionadded:: 0.22

    Parameters
    ----------
    mode : {'distance', 'connectivity'}, default='distance'
        Type of returned matrix: 'connectivity' will return the connectivity
        matrix with ones and zeros, and 'distance' will return the distances
        between neighbors according to the given metric.

    n_neighbors : int, default=5
        Number of neighbors for each sample in the transformed sparse graph.
        For compatibility reasons, as each sample is considered as its own
        neighbor, one extra neighbor will be computed when mode == 'distance'.
        In this case, the sparse graph contains (n_neighbors + 1) neighbors.

    algorithm : {'auto', 'ball_tree', 'kd_tree', 'brute'}, default='auto'
        Algorithm used to compute the nearest neighbors:

        - 'ball_tree' will use :class:`BallTree`
        - 'kd_tree' will use :class:`KDTree`
        - 'brute' will use a brute-force search.
        - 'auto' will attempt to decide the most appropriate algorithm
          based on the values passed to :meth:`fit` method.

        Note: fitting on sparse input will override the setting of
        this parameter, using brute force.

    leaf_size : int, default=30
        Leaf size passed to BallTree or KDTree.  This can affect the
        speed of the construction and query, as well as the memory
        required to store the tree.  The optimal value depends on the
        nature of the problem.

    metric : str or callable, default='minkowski'
        Metric to use for distance computation. Default is "minkowski", which
        results in the standard Euclidean distance when p = 2. See the
        documentation of `scipy.spatial.distance
        <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/spatial.distance.html>`_ and
        the metrics listed in
        :class:`~sklearn.metrics.pairwise.distance_metrics` for valid metric
        values.

        If metric is a callable function, it takes two arrays representing 1D
        vectors as inputs and must return one value indicating the distance
        between those vectors. This works for Scipy's metrics, but is less
        efficient than passing the metric name as a string.

        Distance matrices are not supported.

    p : int, default=2
        Parameter for the Minkowski metric from
        sklearn.metrics.pairwise.pairwise_distances. When p = 1, this is
        equivalent to using manhattan_distance (l1), and euclidean_distance
        (l2) for p = 2. For arbitrary p, minkowski_distance (l_p) is used.

    metric_params : dict, default=None
        Additional keyword arguments for the metric function.

    n_jobs : int, default=1
        The number of parallel jobs to run for neighbors search.
        If ``-1``, then the number of jobs is set to the number of CPU cores.

    Attributes
    ----------
    effective_metric_ : str or callable
        The distance metric used. It will be same as the `metric` parameter
        or a synonym of it, e.g. 'euclidean' if the `metric` parameter set to
        'minkowski' and `p` parameter set to 2.

    effective_metric_params_ : dict
        Additional keyword arguments for the metric function. For most metrics
        will be same with `metric_params` parameter, but may also contain the
        `p` parameter value if the `effective_metric_` attribute is set to
        'minkowski'.

    n_features_in_ : int
        Number of features seen during :term:`fit`.

        .. versionadded:: 0.24

    feature_names_in_ : ndarray of shape (`n_features_in_`,)
        Names of features seen during :term:`fit`. Defined only when `X`
