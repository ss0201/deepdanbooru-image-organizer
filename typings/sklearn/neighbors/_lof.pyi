    """Unsupervised Outlier Detection using the Local Outlier Factor (LOF).

    The anomaly score of each sample is called the Local Outlier Factor.
    It measures the local deviation of the density of a given sample with respect
    to its neighbors.
    It is local in that the anomaly score depends on how isolated the object
    is with respect to the surrounding neighborhood.
    More precisely, locality is given by k-nearest neighbors, whose distance
    is used to estimate the local density.
    By comparing the local density of a sample to the local densities of its
    neighbors, one can identify samples that have a substantially lower density
    than their neighbors. These are considered outliers.

    .. versionadded:: 0.19

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_neighbors : int, default=20
        Number of neighbors to use by default for :meth:`kneighbors` queries.
        If n_neighbors is larger than the number of samples provided,
        all samples will be used.

    algorithm : {'auto', 'ball_tree', 'kd_tree', 'brute'}, default='auto'
        Algorithm used to compute the nearest neighbors:

        - 'ball_tree' will use :class:`BallTree`
        - 'kd_tree' will use :class:`KDTree`
        - 'brute' will use a brute-force search.
        - 'auto' will attempt to decide the most appropriate algorithm
          based on the values passed to :meth:`fit` method.

        Note: fitting on sparse input will override the setting of
        this parameter, using brute force.

    leaf_size : int, default=30
        Leaf is size passed to :class:`BallTree` or :class:`KDTree`. This can
        affect the speed of the construction and query, as well as the memory
        required to store the tree. The optimal value depends on the
        nature of the problem.

    metric : str or callable, default='minkowski'
        Metric to use for distance computation. Default is "minkowski", which
        results in the standard Euclidean distance when p = 2. See the
        documentation of `scipy.spatial.distance
        <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/spatial.distance.html>`_ and
        the metrics listed in
        :class:`~sklearn.metrics.pairwise.distance_metrics` for valid metric
        values.

        If metric is "precomputed", X is assumed to be a distance matrix and
        must be square during fit. X may be a :term:`sparse graph`, in which
        case only "nonzero" elements may be considered neighbors.

        If metric is a callable function, it takes two arrays representing 1D
        vectors as inputs and must return one value indicating the distance
        between those vectors. This works for Scipy's metrics, but is less
        efficient than passing the metric name as a string.

    p : int, default=2
        Parameter for the Minkowski metric from
        :func:`sklearn.metrics.pairwise.pairwise_distances`. When p = 1, this
        is equivalent to using manhattan_distance (l1), and euclidean_distance
        (l2) for p = 2. For arbitrary p, minkowski_distance (l_p) is used.

    metric_params : dict, default=None
        Additional keyword arguments for the metric function.

    contamination : 'auto' or float, default='auto'
        The amount of contamination of the data set, i.e. the proportion
        of outliers in the data set. When fitting this is used to define the
        threshold on the scores of the samples.

        - if 'auto', the threshold is determined as in the
          original paper,
        - if a float, the contamination should be in the range (0, 0.5].

        .. versionchanged:: 0.22
           The default value of ``contamination`` changed from 0.1
           to ``'auto'``.

    novelty : bool, default=False
        By default, LocalOutlierFactor is only meant to be used for outlier
        detection (novelty=False). Set novelty to True if you want to use
        LocalOutlierFactor for novelty detection. In this case be aware that
        you should only use predict, decision_function and score_samples
        on new unseen data and not on the training set; and note that the
        results obtained this way may differ from the standard LOF results.

        .. versionadded:: 0.20

    n_jobs : int, default=None
        The number of parallel jobs to run for neighbors search.
        ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context.
        ``-1`` means using all processors. See :term:`Glossary <n_jobs>`
        for more details.

    Attributes
    ----------
    negative_outlier_factor_ : ndarray of shape (n_samples,)
        The opposite LOF of the training samples. The higher, the more normal.
        Inliers tend to have a LOF score close to 1
        (``negative_outlier_factor_`` close to -1), while outliers tend to have
        a larger LOF score.

        The local outlier factor (LOF) of a sample captures its
        supposed 'degree of abnormality'.
        It is the average of the ratio of the local reachability density of
        a sample and those of its k-nearest neighbors.

    n_neighbors_ : int
        The actual number of neighbors used for :meth:`kneighbors` queries.

    offset_ : float
        Offset used to obtain binary labels from the raw scores.
        Observations having a negative_outlier_factor smaller than `offset_`
        are detected as abnormal.
        The offset is set to -1.5 (inliers score around -1), except when a
        contamination parameter different than "auto" is provided. In that
        case, the offset is defined in such a way we obtain the expected
        number of outliers in training.

        .. versionadded:: 0.20

    effective_metric_ : str
        The effective metric used for the distance computation.

    effective_metric_params_ : dict
        The effective additional keyword arguments for the metric function.

    n_features_in_ : int
        Number of features seen during :term:`fit`.

        .. versionadded:: 0.24

    feature_names_in_ : ndarray of shape (`n_features_in_`,)
        Names of features seen during :term:`fit`. Defined only when `X`
        has feature names that are all strings.

        .. versionadded:: 1.0

    n_samples_fit_ : int
        It is the number of samples in the fitted data.
