    """Loads the Fashion-MNIST dataset.

    This is a dataset of 60,000 28x28 grayscale images of 10 fashion categories,
    along with a test set of 10,000 images. This dataset can be used as
    a drop-in replacement for MNIST.

    The classes are:

    | Label | Description |
    |:-----:|-------------|
    |   0   | T-shirt/top |
    |   1   | Trouser     |
    |   2   | Pullover    |
    |   3   | Dress       |
    |   4   | Coat        |
    |   5   | Sandal      |
    |   6   | Shirt       |
    |   7   | Sneaker     |
    |   8   | Bag         |
    |   9   | Ankle boot  |

    Returns:
      Tuple of NumPy arrays: `(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test)`.

    **x_train**: uint8 NumPy array of grayscale image data with shapes
      `(60000, 28, 28)`, containing the training data.

    **y_train**: uint8 NumPy array of labels (integers in range 0-9)
      with shape `(60000,)` for the training data.

    **x_test**: uint8 NumPy array of grayscale image data with shapes
      (10000, 28, 28), containing the test data.

    **y_test**: uint8 NumPy array of labels (integers in range 0-9)
      with shape `(10000,)` for the test data.

    Example:

    ```python
    (x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = fashion_mnist.load_data()
    assert x_train.shape == (60000, 28, 28)
    assert x_test.shape == (10000, 28, 28)
    assert y_train.shape == (60000,)
    assert y_test.shape == (10000,)
    ```
