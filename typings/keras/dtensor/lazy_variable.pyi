    The major use case for this class is to serve as a memory efficient
    alternative for tf.Variable. The resource handle of this class is point to
    nothing, which mean it will raise error when its value is fetched in a eager
    context. Having said that, it will perform like a normal tf.Variable when
    using with graph tensor, like KerasTensor produced from tf.keras.Input.
