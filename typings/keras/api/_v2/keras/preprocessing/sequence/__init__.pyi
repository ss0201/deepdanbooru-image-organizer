"""Utilities for preprocessing sequence data.

Deprecated: `tf.keras.preprocessing.sequence` APIs are not recommended for new
code. Prefer `tf.keras.utils.timeseries_dataset_from_array` and
the `tf.data` APIs which provide a much more flexible mechanisms for dealing
with sequences. See the [tf.data guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/data)
for more details.
