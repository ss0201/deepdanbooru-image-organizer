    """A layer for sequence input.

    All `feature_columns` must be sequence dense columns with the same
    `sequence_length`. The output of this method can be fed into sequence
    networks, such as RNN.

    The output of this method is a 3D `Tensor` of shape `[batch_size, T, D]`.
    `T` is the maximum sequence length for this batch, which could differ from
    batch to batch.

    If multiple `feature_columns` are given with `Di` `num_elements` each, their
    outputs are concatenated. So, the final `Tensor` has shape
    `[batch_size, T, D0 + D1 + ... + Dn]`.

    Example:

    ```python

    import tensorflow as tf

    # Behavior of some cells or feature columns may depend on whether we are in
    # training or inference mode, e.g. applying dropout.
    training = True
    rating = tf.feature_column.sequence_numeric_column('rating')
    watches = tf.feature_column.sequence_categorical_column_with_identity(
        'watches', num_buckets=1000)
    watches_embedding = tf.feature_column.embedding_column(watches,
                                                dimension=10)
    columns = [rating, watches_embedding]

    features = {
     'rating': tf.sparse.from_dense([[1.0,1.1, 0, 0, 0],
                                                 [2.0,2.1,2.2, 2.3, 2.5]]),
     'watches': tf.sparse.from_dense([[2, 85, 0, 0, 0],[33,78, 2, 73, 1]])
    }

    sequence_input_layer = tf.keras.experimental.SequenceFeatures(columns)
    sequence_input, sequence_length = sequence_input_layer(
       features, training=training)
    sequence_length_mask = tf.sequence_mask(sequence_length)
    hidden_size = 32
    rnn_cell = tf.keras.layers.SimpleRNNCell(hidden_size)
    rnn_layer = tf.keras.layers.RNN(rnn_cell)
    outputs, state = rnn_layer(sequence_input, mask=sequence_length_mask)
