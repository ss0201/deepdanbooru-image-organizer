  r"""Applies sparse addition to individual values or slices in a Variable.

  `ref` is a `Tensor` with rank `P` and `indices` is a `Tensor` of rank `Q`.

  `indices` must be integer tensor, containing indices into `ref`.
  It must be shape `[d_0, ..., d_{Q-2}, K]` where `0 < K <= P`.

  The innermost dimension of `indices` (with length `K`) corresponds to
  indices into elements (if `K = P`) or slices (if `K < P`) along the `K`th
  dimension of `ref`.

  `updates` is `Tensor` of rank `Q-1+P-K` with shape:

  ```
  [d_0, ..., d_{Q-2}, ref.shape[K], ..., ref.shape[P-1]]
  ```

  For example, say we want to add 4 scattered elements to a rank-1 tensor to
  8 elements. In Python, that addition would look like this:

  ```python
  ref = tf.Variable([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8])

  add = tf.scatter_nd_add(ref, indices, updates)
  with tf.Session() as sess:
    print sess.run(add)
  ```

  The resulting update to ref would look like this:

      [1, 13, 3, 14, 14, 6, 7, 20]

  See `tf.scatter_nd` for more details about how to make updates to
  slices.
