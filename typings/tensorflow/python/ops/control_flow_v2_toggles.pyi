  control flow v2 (cfv2) is an improved version of control flow in TensorFlow
  with support for higher order derivatives. Enabling cfv2 will change the
  graph/function representation of control flow, e.g., `tf.while_loop` and
  `tf.cond` will generate functional `While` and `If` ops instead of low-level
  `Switch`, `Merge` etc. ops. Note: Importing and running graphs exported
  with old control flow will still be supported.

  Calling tf.enable_control_flow_v2() lets you opt-in to this TensorFlow 2.0
  feature.

  Note: v2 control flow is always enabled inside of tf.function. Calling this
  function is not required.

  """Whether to output all intermediates from functional control flow ops.

  The "default" behavior to is to output all intermediates when using v2 control
  flow inside Keras models in graph mode (possibly inside Estimators). This is
  needed to support taking gradients of v2 control flow. In graph mode, Keras
  can sometimes freeze the forward graph before the gradient computation which
  does not work for v2 control flow since it requires updating the forward ops
  to output the needed intermediates. We work around this by proactively
  outputting the needed intermediates when building the forward pass itself.
  Ideally any such extra tensors should be pruned out at runtime. However, if
  for any reason this doesn't work for you or if you have an inference-only
  model you can turn this behavior off using
  `tf.compat.v1.experimental.output_all_intermediates(False)`.

  If with the default behavior you are still seeing errors of the form
  "Connecting to invalid output X of source node Y which has Z outputs" try
  setting `tf.compat.v1.experimental.output_all_intermediates(True)` and
  please file an issue at https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues.

  Args:
    state: True, False or None. None restores the default behavior.
