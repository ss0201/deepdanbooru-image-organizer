def conjugate_gradient(operator, rhs, preconditioner=..., x=..., tol=..., max_iter=..., name=...): # -> CGState:
  r"""Conjugate gradient solver.

  Solves a linear system of equations `A*x = rhs` for self-adjoint, positive
  definite matrix `A` and right-hand side vector `rhs`, using an iterative,
  matrix-free algorithm where the action of the matrix A is represented by
  `operator`. The iteration terminates when either the number of iterations
  exceeds `max_iter` or when the residual norm has been reduced to `tol`
  times its initial value, i.e. \\(||rhs - A x_k|| <= tol ||rhs||\\).

  Args:
    operator: A `LinearOperator` that is self-adjoint and positive definite.
    rhs: A possibly batched vector of shape `[..., N]` containing the right-hand
      size vector.
    preconditioner: A `LinearOperator` that approximates the inverse of `A`.
      An efficient preconditioner could dramatically improve the rate of
      convergence. If `preconditioner` represents matrix `M`(`M` approximates
      `A^{-1}`), the algorithm uses `preconditioner.apply(x)` to estimate
      `A^{-1}x`. For this to be useful, the cost of applying `M` should be
      much lower than computing `A^{-1}` directly.
    x: A possibly batched vector of shape `[..., N]` containing the initial
      guess for the solution.
    tol: A float scalar convergence tolerance.
    max_iter: An integer giving the maximum number of iterations.
    name: A name scope for the operation.

  Returns:
    output: A namedtuple representing the final state with fields:
      - i: A scalar `int32` `Tensor`. Number of iterations executed.
      - x: A rank-1 `Tensor` of shape `[..., N]` containing the computed
          solution.
      - r: A rank-1 `Tensor` of shape `[.., M]` containing the residual vector.
      - p: A rank-1 `Tensor` of shape `[..., N]`. `A`-conjugate basis vector.
      - gamma: \\(r \dot M \dot r\\), equivalent to  \\(||r||_2^2\\) when
        `preconditioner=None`.
